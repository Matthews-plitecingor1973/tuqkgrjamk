Dude, I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Cleaner, and I don't even know where to start. You ever 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 something and halfway through you're just like, “What am I even 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨?” It’s like, is this supposed to be a thriller or just a giant mind trip? Anyway, I 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   last night, figured I'd give it a shot, you know?

Samuel L. Jackson was in it, so I thought, how bad could it be, right? I mean, the guy can pretty much save anything, but even he seemed a little confused by the whole thing. Honestly, it felt like someone just threw in all these random plot twists thinking they’d blow our minds, but it’s like, can you just chill and stick to one storyline? 

> And for real, I was all for the mystery vibe at first, but then it got cluttered. Like, there’s only so many sudden twists and deep looks into the camera I can take before I start rolling my eyes. But what do I know, maybe it's art or something. 

Oh, and then there's this whole thing with his daughter. I swear, every time they had a scene together, I just wanted to give her a cookie or something. Why's everyone so intense? It should’ve been heartwarming but felt low-key stressful instead. I mean, when I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 a  , I want either edge-of-my-seat thrills or feel-good moments. Is that too much to ask?

And don’t even get me started on how the whole cover-up thing went down. 🙄 Like, hey, how about we explain that a little better? Instead, it just kind of plopped out of nowhere. Maybe they thought leaving us hanging would be cool, but nah, just confusing.

while (i < array.length) { process(array[i]); i++; }  

Anyway, I'm just venting at this point. Might need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 something lighter afterward to recover from the whole ordeal. But hey, if you're curious, maybe don't take my word for it and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   yourself. Or just call me instead, and we’ll pick it apart together. Grab popcorn, 'cause we’re gonna need a lot.
